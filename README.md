# basic-compose
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/basic-compose.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/basic-compose/)

basic functional composition function. 283 ES5 bytes gziped.

returns a function that sequentially calls all given functions
from last to first:
```js
compose: (..., f3, f2, f1) => {
  x => ...(f3(f2(f1(x))))
  (...c, x) => compose(..., f3.curry(...c), f2.curry(...c), f1.curry(...c))(x)
}
```
when the composed function is called with more than one argument `(...c, x)`,
it acts as if all given functions had been curried
with the leading context arguments `...c`,
without the overhead of actually currying each function.
this is useful, e.g. for composing reducers:
```js
const reducer = compose(reducerC, reducerB, reducerA)
reducer(previous, current) ===
  reducerC(previous, reducerB(previous, reducerA(previous, current)))
```

```ts
import compose from 'basic-compose'
import { map, take, tap } from 'rxjs/operators'
import { interval } from 'rxjs/observable/interval'
import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';

interval(1000).pipe(
  take(5),
  tap(log('input:')),
  compose<Observable<string>>(
    map((s: string) => `${s.length}${s}`),
    map((x: number) => '.'.repeat(x)),
    map((x: number) => 4 - x)
  )
)
.subscribe(log('output:'), log('error:'), log('done'))
```
# API
```ts
declare function compose <O>(...fns: Function[]): (...args: any[]) => O
declare function compose <O>(fns: Function[]): (...args: any[]) => O

# TypeScript
although this library is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org),
it may also be imported into plain JavaScript code:
modern code editors will still benefit from the available type definition,
e.g. for helpful code completion.
