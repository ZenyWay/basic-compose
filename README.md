interval(1000).pipe(
  take(5),
  tap(log('input:')),
  compose<Observable<number>,Observable<string>>(
    map((s: string) => `${s.length}${s}`),
    map((x: number) => '.'.repeat(x)),
    map((x: number) => 4 - x)

declare function compose <I,O>(fns: Function[]): (v: I) => O
```

although this library is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org),
it may also be imported into plain JavaScript code:
modern code editors will still benefit from the available type definition,
e.g. for helpful code completion.
